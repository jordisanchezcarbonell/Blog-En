The metaphor of sheep, wolves, and sheepdogs offers an intriguing insight into the dynamics of human nature and society. This classification not only invites reflection on individual and collective behavior but also encourages us to consider how each of us can influence our environment.

## Sheep

Sheep represent people who live in a reality where they prefer to believe that evil does not exist. This group could be characterized by their naivety, trust, and sometimes their vulnerability. Living like a sheep can imply a life of peace and tranquility, but also exposure to danger when evil or violence crosses their path. However, we should not see sheep only as weak or ignorant; often, their approach to life is a conscious act of rejecting violence and a desire to live in harmony.

## Wolves

Wolves, on the other hand, are those who use violence and power to take advantage of others. They represent evil, corruption, and exploitation. In society, wolves are the people who seek to dominate and control others for their own benefit, without consideration for others' well-being. This behavior can arise from a combination of factors such as greed, lack of empathy, or a distorted view of power and success.

## Sheepdogs

Finally, sheepdogs are the guardians, those who feel the need and duty to protect the most vulnerable. They are the people who confront evil and defend justice, often at the expense of their own safety. This group can be made up of police officers, soldiers, activists, and other defenders of public welfare. Being a sheepdog implies a willingness to engage in controlled and directed aggression to maintain the flock's order and security.

## Personal and Social Reflection

The metaphor leads us to ask: in which category do we see ourselves? Are we sheep, wolves, or sheepdogs? And beyond that, what kind of people do we want to be? It is crucial to recognize that these categories are neither absolute nor static. People can change and evolve, and it is possible that we all carry a bit of each within us at different times in our lives.

The final teaching, "we don't raise sheep in this family," suggests a proactive approach to education and upbringing, fostering courage, responsibility, and the ability to protect oneself and others. However, it is important to balance this teaching with empathy and understanding, avoiding creating an environment that glorifies violence or unnecessary conflict.

In summary, this reflection invites us to consider how we can positively contribute to our community and how we can prepare to face adversities, whether by protecting others or being aware of the dangers around us.
